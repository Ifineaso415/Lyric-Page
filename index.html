    <H3>LYRICS:</H3>
    <p>All through, my days at school<br>
I often think of you, my darling baby boo<br>
Your always in my head,<br>
that's why I can't wait to go to bed<br>
To close my eyes and visualize<br>
You right by my side</p><br>
<p>Your my dream girl, Living in my dream world<br>
I'm in love with you, <br>
please don't wake me up<br>
Your my dream girl, living in my dream world<br>
I'm in love with you, <br>
 please don't wake me up, please don't wake me up</p><br>
